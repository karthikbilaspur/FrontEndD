Q: How can I improve the performance of my TypeScript code?
A: Use type optimization techniques like type inference and type guards. Avoid unnecessary type casts.

Q: What are some best practices for testing TypeScript code?
A: Write unit tests and integration tests using a testing framework like Jest. Use mocking libraries to isolate dependencies.

Q: How should I document my TypeScript code?
