        <h1>Web Hosting</h1>
        <p>Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to post a website or web page onto the internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed on the internet.</p>
