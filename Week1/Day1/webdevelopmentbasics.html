        <p>Web development is a constantly evolving field, with new technologies and trends emerging all the time. 🚀</p>
        <h2>Web Development Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>If you’re thinking about starting web development, you’re about to begin an exciting journey!</p>
        <p>But before you jump in and start coding, it’s a good idea to understand the basics of how the web works. Knowing all the key concepts and tools before you actually start learning them will help you get a clearer picture and save time later.</p>
        <h3>1. Starting Your Web Adventure: The Browser</h3>
        <p>You open your favorite web browser, let’s say Chrome, and type in the web address of your beloved pizza place, like www.pizzayum.com. Your browser, which is basically your gateway to the web, is about to get busy.</p>
        <h3>2. Web Server</h3>
        <p>A web server refers to both the hardware and software responsible for storing and delivering website data. It acts as the central system that hosts website files and responds to requests made by browsers.</p>
        <h3>3. Web Protocols: Communication Between Browser and Server</h3>
        <p>Now that we know the request is sent, we need to understand the protocols that make all this communication possible.</p>
        <h3>4. Database: Storing and Retrieving Content</h3>
        <p>Many websites, including the pizza place’s website, rely on databases to store dynamic content. These databases hold everything from the pizza menu, your past orders, and even customer reviews.</p>
        <h3>5. Back to Your Screen: Rendering the Web Page</h3>
        <p>With the data now in hand (HTML, CSS, images, etc.), the browser’s job is to render the page and display it for you.</p>
        <h3>6. Web Security: Protecting You on the Internet</h3>
        <p>Security is essential when interacting with websites. Here are the key elements of web security:</p>
        <h3>7. The Full Process in Action:</h3>
        <p>You type www.pizzayum.com into the browser.</p>
        <p>DNS translates the URL to an IP address.</p>
        <p>HTTP(S) request is sent to the server.</p>
        <p>The server checks its database for the requested data (like the pizza menu).</p>
        <p>The server sends the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript back to the browser.</p>
        <p>Your browser uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the page and display the pizza menu.</p>
        <p>If applicable, SSL/TLS encrypts your communication, and cookies/sessions keep you logged in for future visits.</p>
        <p>Your secure, interactive pizza menu is ready to explore!</p>
        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. It's like constructing a building, but instead of bricks and mortar, you're using code.</p>
        <h3>The Two Main Parts of Web Development: Front-End and Back-End</h3>
        <p>In web development, we generally talk about two major parts:</p>
        <h3>1. Front-End Development: The "Face" of the Website</h3>
        <p>Front-end development deals with everything that users interact with directly. It’s what you see on a website: buttons, images, text, videos, and everything else that makes the website functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <h3>2. Back-End Development: The Engine Under the Hood</h3>
        <p>Back-end development is like the engine of a car. It's not something users directly see or interact with, but without it, nothing would work.</p>
        <h3>Full-Stack Development: Combining Both Worlds</h3>
        <p>If front-end is the face of a website and back-end is the engine, full-stack development is the person who knows how to build both.</p>
        <h3>Key Tools in Web Development</h3>
        <p>Text Editors: Developers write code in text editors. Some popular ones include:</p>
        <p>VS Code (Visual Studio Code): A powerful, user-friendly editor with a lot of features to help developers.</p>
        <p>Sublime Text: A lightweight text editor known for its speed and simplicity.</p>
        <p>Version Control: As a developer, you’ll often work with teams, and it’s crucial to keep track of all changes made to a project. This is where version control comes in.</p>
        <p>Git: A tool that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. GitHub is a platform where developers store and share their code.</p>
        <p>Web Browsers: Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari are where you test and preview your websites. Developers also use developer tools in browsers to debug code and check for errors.</p>
        <p>Frameworks and Libraries: These are pre-written pieces of code that help developers build websites faster. For example:</p>
        <p>React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap: A CSS framework that helps you create responsive, mobile-friendly websites.</p>
        <p>Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building back-end applications.</p>
